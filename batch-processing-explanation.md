# Batch Processing Logic in Call Info Remover

## How Batch Processing Works

When multiple files are uploaded in the Call Info Remover application, they are processed in sequence, one at a time. Here's the flow:

1. **File Selection**: User selects multiple files for upload
2. **Sequential Processing**: Files are processed one by one, not in parallel
3. **For Each File**:
   - File is uploaded to the server via XHR request
   - Server returns a job ID
   - Frontend polls the server for job status using that ID
   - When job is complete, next file starts processing

## The Issue

The original code had a problem: even though each file was processed sequentially, the UI would only update the recordings list after ALL files were processed. This meant users couldn't see or access any processed files until the entire batch was complete.

The issue was in the code flow:
1. File 1 is processed
2. Frontend immediately starts processing File 2
3. The recordings list update for File 1 gets delayed or blocked by File 2's processing

## The Fix

Our comprehensive fix addresses this issue by:

1. **Promise-Based Approach**: Converting the `fetchRecordings()` function to return a Promise, allowing better control of the execution flow

2. **Sequencing Operations**: Ensuring the recordings list is updated BEFORE starting to process the next file

3. **Adding Delay**: Including a small delay (500ms) before fetching recordings to ensure the server has time to update

4. **Error Handling**: Adding robust error handling to ensure the process continues even if there's an issue updating the recordings list

5. **Detailed Logging**: Adding more console logs to help diagnose any issues

## Before vs After

### Before:
```javascript
if (data.status === 'completed') {
    // Processing complete
    clearInterval(pollInterval);
    successCount++;
    console.log(`File ${fileIndex + 1} processed successfully:`, data.result);
    
    // Update the recordings list immediately when a file is processed
    fetchRecordings();
    
    // Process next file
    currentFileIndex++;
    processNextFile();
}
```

### After:
```javascript
if (data.status === 'completed') {
    // Processing complete
    clearInterval(pollInterval);
    successCount++;
    console.log(`File ${fileIndex + 1} processed successfully:`, data.result);
    
    // Update the recordings list immediately when a file is processed
    console.log(`Updating recordings list after file ${fileIndex + 1} (${fileName}) was processed`);
    
    // Add a small delay before fetching recordings to ensure the server has time to update
    setTimeout(() => {
        fetchRecordings()
            .then(() => {
                console.log(`Recordings list updated successfully after file ${fileIndex + 1}`);
                // Process next file after recordings are updated
                currentFileIndex++;
                processNextFile();
            })
            .catch(err => {
                console.error(`Error updating recordings after file ${fileIndex + 1}:`, err);
                // Still process next file even if there was an error updating recordings
                currentFileIndex++;
                processNextFile();
            });
    }, 500);
}
```

## Result

With this fix, each file will appear in the recordings list immediately after it's processed, without waiting for all files in the batch to be processed. This provides a better user experience, especially when processing multiple large files.
